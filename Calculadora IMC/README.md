## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a calculator that allows users to compute their BMI in a practical and intuitive way, while reinforcing the following concepts:
- Structuring pages with *HTML*;
- Styling with *CSS*;
- Implementing interactive features with *JavaScript*.

Additionally, the project adheres to coding best practices and serves as a practical example to learn and demonstrate the logic behind a front-end application.

## Features

- Input fields for the user to enter their *weight* (in kg) and *height* (in meters).
- A calculate button that displays the *BMI* and the corresponding *classification* according to the World Health Organization guidelines:
  - Underweight
  - Normal weight
  - Overweight
  - Obesity grades 1, 2, or 3
- Responsive and user-friendly interface for different devices.
